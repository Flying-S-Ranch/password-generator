## PASSWORD-GENERATOR

# DESCRIPTION
This project creates a randomly generated password with the length and combination of characters chosen by the user. This project was built upon starter code and gave me the opportunity to practice many parts of JavaScript including for loops, arrays, and conditional statements. This project helps people create secure and unique passwords. You can access the webpage at https://flying-s-ranch.github.io/password-generator.
